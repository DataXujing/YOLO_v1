# YOLO_v1
YOLO_v1 is a simple implementation of YOLO v1 by Keras with Tensorflow backend which described in the next paper:
* [You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640)

But actually this is not a good implementation and I have not achieved the same performance as the original one.
Further more,[YOLO v2](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) has come out,so you can turn to [experiencor/basic-yolo-keras](https://github.com/experiencor/basic-yolo-keras)
which I think is a good implementation of YOLO v2 with Keras if you want to train faster and better.

To use this implementation, you have to download the weights files from [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1YsJAVf0CnlG87-MlKd1X2w).
